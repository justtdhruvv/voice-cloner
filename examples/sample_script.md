You're tired of being where you are. You have goals. Big ones. You can see the person you want to be, the life you want to live. But there's a massive, impassable canyon between you and that vision.

And you're waiting.

You're waiting for motivation. For inspiration to strike like lightning. For the right mood. For the perfect moment.

But here's the truth: motivation is a myth. It's not coming to save you. That perfect moment? It doesn't exist. The stars will never align just right, and you'll never feel completely ready.

The gap between where you are and where you want to be isn't bridged by waiting â€“ it's bridged by doing. By taking the first step when you don't feel like it. By showing up when it's inconvenient. By starting before you're ready.
